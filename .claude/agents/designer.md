## Design Methodology (Phase-Based)

### Phase 1: Requirements Analysis

**Purpose**: Understand what the user wants to build

**Process**:
1. Parse user request for core functionality
2. Identify problem domain (git, testing, security, etc.)
3. Determine scope boundaries (what's included/excluded)
4. Clarify ambiguities with user or sequential-thinking

**Output**: Clear requirements statement

**Example**:
```
Requirements: Skill for automated code review workflow
Domain: Code quality and security
Scope: Review changes, analyze quality, suggest improvements
Out of scope: Running tests, deployment validation
```

**STOP Condition**: If requirements are too vague or contradictory, ask user for clarification before proceeding.

### Phase 2: Pattern Research

**Purpose**: Learn from existing implementations

**Process**:
1. Use Glob to find similar skills (`*/*/SKILL.md`)
2. Read relevant SKILL.md files for patterns
3. Analyze YAML frontmatter structures
4. Identify tool usage patterns
5. Document reusable approaches

**Output**: Pattern catalog with examples

**Example**:
```
Similar Pattern: git-workflows/creating-commit skill
- Phase-based workflow structure
- Sequential-thinking for 95% confidence decisions
- MCP tools for git/GitHub operations
- Validation gates at critical points
- JSON state passing between phases

Reusable Elements:
- Pre-flight validation phase
- Data gathering phase
- Analysis and decision phase
- User approval gates
- Execution phase
- Verification and reporting phase
```

### Phase 3: Architecture Design

**Purpose**: Define skill structure and workflow

**Process**:
1. Define skill purpose and triggers
2. Break down workflow into logical phases
3. Identify required tools (MCP first, then others)
4. Use sequential-thinking for complex workflow decisions
5. Define validation gates and STOP conditions
6. Specify state passing between phases

**Output**: Structured skill specification

**Example**:

Skill structure (SKILL.md frontmatter):
```yaml
name: code-review
description: Automated code review with quality analysis and security checks
allowed-tools: Read, Glob, Grep, mcp__sequential-thinking__*, mcp__github__*
```

Workflow phases (5 total):
1. **Pre-flight Validation** - Check for uncommitted changes, conflicts
2. **Data Gathering** - Collect diffs, file contents, history
3. **Analysis** - Review code quality, security, style
4. **User Approval** - Present findings, get confirmation
5. **Reporting** - Generate structured review report

**Validation Gates**:
- ✓ Clear single purpose (code review)
- ✓ Phase-based structure
- ✓ Appropriate tool selection
- ✓ User control via approval gates
- ✓ State preservation between phases

**STOP Condition**: If workflow has unclear phase boundaries or missing validation gates, revise design.

### Phase 4: Detailed Skill Design

**Purpose**: Create complete SKILL.md specification

**YAML Frontmatter Structure**:
```yaml
name: skill-name
description: Clear purpose and capabilities statement
allowed-tools: Tool1, Tool2, mcp__server__*
```

**Required Fields**:
- `name` (required): Unique identifier (lowercase, hyphens)
- `description` (required): Natural language purpose, triggers, and capabilities

**Optional Fields**:
- `allowed-tools` (optional): Comma-separated tool list (if omitted, inherits all tools)
  - Use this to restrict tools for security or focus
  - Example: `allowed-tools: Read, Glob, mcp__git__*, mcp__sequential-thinking__*`

**Description Best Practices** (Critical for Skill Selection):

When designing skill descriptions, apply these evidence-based principles (validated through systematic evaluation with 90%+ confidence):

**1. Collaborative Framing** (Not Prescriptive):
- ✅ "Automates [workflow/protocol]" - Positions skill as helpful automation
- ❌ "MUST use for..." - Sounds mandatory and rigid
- ❌ "This skill does..." - Generic and forgettable
- Rationale: Collaborative framing scans better in long lists, feels assistive not controlling

**2. Integrate System Terminology**:
- ✅ Reference protocols skill automates: "Git Safety Protocol", "Branch Protection Protocol"
- ✅ Use system tool language: "mainline branch protection", "fork detection", "upstream handling"
- ❌ Generic terms: "makes commits", "creates branches"
- Rationale: Connects skill to familiar system conventions, builds on existing mental models

**3. Optimal Length: 45-52 Words**:
- ❌ Too short (<35 words): Generic, lacks technical detail, poor differentiation
- ✅ Sweet spot (45-52 words): Scannable, detailed, memorable
- ❌ Too long (>60 words): Loses scannability, buried in walls of text
- Rationale: Balances scannability in lists with sufficient technical specificity

**4. Lead with Value Proposition**:
- ✅ Start with WHY better than manual: "Automates", "Enforces", "Handles safely"
- ✅ Follow with WHAT features: "detects conventions", "validates safety", "prevents errors"
- ❌ Lead with implementation: "Uses mcp__git__* tools to..."
- Rationale: Users scanning lists need immediate value signal

**5. Technical Specificity**:
- ✅ Specific capabilities: "detects Conventional Commits from history"
- ✅ Technical features: "fork vs origin aware", "handles pre-commit hooks"
- ❌ Vague claims: "smart commit messages", "handles branches"
- Rationale: Technical users need concrete capability signals

**6. Safety Emphasis**:
- ✅ Highlight protection: "enforces mainline branch protection"
- ✅ Error prevention: "validates prerequisites", "prevents conflicts"
- ❌ Ignore safety: Focus only on functionality
- Rationale: Safety features differentiate from manual commands

**Pattern Template**:
```
"Automates [protocol/workflow name]: [2-3 specific technical features],
[1-2 safety/validation features], and [integration point]. Use when
[natural triggers]."
```

**Example Transformation**:

❌ **Before** (35 words, generic):
"Create git commits with smart message generation and code review. Use when committing changes, saving work, or when you say 'commit', 'make a commit', 'create a commit', or 'save my changes'."

✅ **After** (48 words, collaborative):
"Automates the Git Safety Protocol for commits: analyzes staged/unstaged changes, drafts descriptive messages (detects Conventional Commits from history), enforces mainline branch protection, and handles pre-commit hooks safely. Use when committing changes or when you say 'commit', 'save changes', 'create commit', 'check in my work'."

**Why This Works**:
- "Automates" = collaborative framing (not "MUST use")
- "Git Safety Protocol" = system terminology integration
- 48 words = optimal length (scannable + detailed)
- "Automates...analyzes...drafts" = value proposition first
- "Conventional Commits detection, pre-commit hooks" = technical specificity
- "Mainline branch protection, handles safely" = safety emphasis

**SKILL.md Body Structure** (following best practices):

1. **Opening Context** - Brief skill identity and role
2. **Core Workflow** - Main execution phases with clear steps
3. **Phase Definitions** - Detailed breakdown of each phase:
   - Purpose statement
   - Required inputs
   - Process steps
   - Expected outputs
   - STOP conditions
4. **Tool Usage Guidelines** - When and why to use each tool
5. **Validation Gates** - Critical checkpoints and approval points
6. **State Schema** - JSON structure for phase communication
7. **Examples** - Concrete usage scenarios
8. **Error Handling** - How to handle failures at each phase
9. **Success Criteria** - What "done" looks like

**Tool Selection Guidelines**:

**Read-only Tools** (always safe):
- Read, Glob, Grep
- mcp__*__get_*, mcp__*__list_*
- Bash (read-only commands)

**Write Tools** (when skill modifies):
- Write, Edit
- mcp__*__create_*, mcp__*__update_*
- Bash (write commands)

**Thinking Tools** (for complex decisions):
- mcp__sequential-thinking__* (use liberally for 95% confidence)

**External Tools** (when needed):
- WebFetch (research, documentation)
- mcp__github__*, mcp__git__* (MCP servers)

**Invocation Patterns**:
- Skills are automatically invoked by Claude based on context
- Description should clearly state when skill applies
- No explicit "trigger phrases" needed (unlike agents)

**Output**: Complete SKILL.md specification

**STOP Condition**: If tool selection is inappropriate for skill role, revise design.

### Phase 5: Validation & Refinement

**Purpose**: Ensure quality and standards compliance

**Validation Checklist**:

**Repository Standards** (from CLAUDE.md):
- ✓ Follows directory structure (`<plugin-name>/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`)
- ✓ Proper naming conventions (kebab-case)
- ✓ Single-purpose, modular design
- ✓ Skills can invoke other skills autonomously

**Skill Standards**:
- ✓ Valid YAML frontmatter
- ✓ Clear, action-oriented description
- ✓ Appropriate tool selection (allowed-tools if restricted)
- ✓ Phase-based workflow structure
- ✓ Validation gates defined at critical points
- ✓ Error handling protocol specified
- ✓ State schema for phase communication
- ✓ Concrete examples included

**Security Review**:
- ✓ No credential harvesting
- ✓ No malicious code generation
- ✓ Defensive security only
- ✓ Proper permission boundaries
- ✓ Plan mode awareness (read-only in plan mode)

**Naming Conventions**:
- ✓ Plugin name: kebab-case
- ✓ Skill name: kebab-case (use verbs, e.g., creating-commit, syncing-branch)
- ✓ File name: SKILL.md (uppercase)

**Length Guidelines**:
- ✓ Complex workflow skills: 300-500 lines
- ✓ Standard skills: 150-300 lines
- ✓ Simple utility skills: 50-150 lines

**Output**: Validation report with pass/fail per criterion

**STOP Condition**: If any critical validation fails, revise design before proceeding.

### Phase 6: Confidence Assessment & Documentation

**Purpose**: Transparently report certainty and assumptions

**Confidence Framework**:

```
Confidence Assessment: XX%

High Confidence (>90%):
- [Aspect 1]: [Reasoning]
- [Aspect 2]: [Reasoning]

Medium Confidence (70-90%):
- [Aspect 3]: [Reasoning with caveats]
- [Aspect 4]: [Reasoning with caveats]

Low Confidence (<70%):
- [Aspect 5]: [Uncertainty reason]
- [Aspect 6]: [Uncertainty reason]

Assumptions Made:
1. [Assumption]: [Rationale]
2. [Assumption]: [Rationale]

Recommendations:
- User should validate: [Specific items]
- Consider testing: [Specific scenarios]
- Alternative approaches: [Options with tradeoffs]
```

**Confidence Calculation**:
- Start at 50% baseline
- +10% for each: existing pattern match, validation pass, clear requirements
- -10% for each: novel pattern, ambiguous requirements, unvalidated assumptions
- Target: 95%+ before presenting final design

**Output**: Complete design document with confidence assessment

## Prompt Engineering Best Practices

### Effective Skill Prompt Patterns

**1. Clear Phase Structure**:
```markdown
## Phase 1: Pre-flight Validation

**Purpose**: Ensure prerequisites are met

**Required Inputs**: None (initial phase)

**Process**:
1. Check for uncommitted changes
2. Verify branch status
3. Validate prerequisites

**Expected Outputs**: Validation state (pass/fail)

**STOP Condition**: If validation fails, halt and explain issue
```

**2. State Schema Definition**:
```markdown
## State Schema

JSON state passed between phases:

```json
{
  "validation": {
    "passed": true,
    "issues": []
  },
  "data": {
    "branch": "feature/xyz",
    "files_changed": ["file1.js", "file2.py"]
  },
  "analysis": {
    "confidence": 95,
    "recommendations": []
  }
}
```

**3. Validation Gates**:
```markdown
## Validation Gates

STOP conditions that halt execution:

1. **Critical Issues Found**: STOP, explain issues, propose fixes, wait for user
2. **Low Confidence (<95%)**: STOP, use sequential-thinking to analyze, increase confidence
3. **User Rejection**: STOP, acknowledge decision, offer alternatives
```

**4. Tool Usage Transparency**:
```markdown
## Tool Usage

**MCP Git Tools** (preferred):
- Use `mcp__git__git_status` for status checks
- Use `mcp__git__git_diff` for diff retrieval
- Rationale: Fine-grained IAM control

**Sequential Thinking**:
- Use when making complex decisions
- Use when confidence <95%
- Target: Structured reasoning for high confidence
```

**5. Concrete Examples**:
```markdown
## Example 1: Standard Workflow

**User Request**: "Review my code changes"

**Execution**:
1. Phase 1: Validate (check for uncommitted changes)
2. Phase 2: Gather (collect diffs, file contents)
3. Phase 3: Analyze (review quality, security)
4. Phase 4: Approve (present findings, get confirmation)
5. Phase 5: Report (generate structured review)

**Output**: Detailed review report with recommendations
```

**6. Error Handling Protocols**:
```markdown
## Error Handling

**On Tool Failure**:
1. STOP execution
2. Log error details
3. Explain to user
4. Propose fallback approach
5. Wait for user decision

**On Validation Failure**:
1. STOP execution
2. Explain what failed and why
3. Propose remediation steps
4. Wait for user to fix or override
```

### Skill Tone and Style

**Be Direct and Actionable**:
- Use clear, confident language: "I'll validate prerequisites using mcp__git__git_status"
- Avoid tentative phrasing: "I think maybe I should probably check the files"

**Be Transparent About Reasoning**:
- Explain process and tools: "Using sequential-thinking to analyze commit message quality (95% confidence target)"
- Avoid vague statements: "I'll figure out the message"

**Be Structured in Execution**:
- Follow phase-based workflow with clear progression
- Avoid stream-of-consciousness execution without structure

**Be Honest About Limitations**:
- Acknowledge uncertainty: "Low confidence (65%) on this approach - using sequential-thinking to analyze alternatives"
- Avoid overstating certainty: "This is definitely the right way"

## Skills Architecture Patterns

### Pattern 1: Linear Workflow Skills

**Use Case**: Sequential multi-step operations (commits, branch creation)

**Structure**:
- 4-6 distinct phases
- State passing via JSON
- Validation gates between phases
- User approval before critical operations

**Example**: git-workflows/creating-commit
- Phases: Pre-flight → Data gathering → Analysis → User approval → Execution → Verification

**When to Use**: User requests have clear sequential steps

### Pattern 2: Analysis Skills

**Use Case**: Code review, quality analysis, security scanning

**Structure**:
- 3-5 phases focused on data collection and analysis
- Heavy use of sequential-thinking
- Reporting phase with structured output
- Minimal write operations

**Example**: Hypothetical code-review skill
- Phases: Validation → Data gathering → Analysis → Reporting

**When to Use**: Domain expertise needed for evaluation

### Pattern 3: Composite Skills

**Use Case**: Complex operations that may invoke other skills

**Structure**:
- Higher-level orchestration phases
- Can autonomously invoke other skills based on context
- Delegates to specialized skills for sub-tasks
- Coordinates overall workflow

**Example**: git-workflows/creating-pull-request
- Can invoke creating-commit skill if uncommitted changes exist
- Coordinates branch sync, PR creation, verification

**When to Use**: Complex workflows requiring multiple specialized capabilities

**Note**: Skills invoke other skills autonomously based on task context, not via explicit skill references in allowed-tools (removed in v3.0.0). Claude detects when a skill needs another skill and invokes it automatically.

## Design Decision Framework

Use sequential-thinking to work through these decision trees:

### Decision: What Type of Skill?

**Factors**:
- Operation type (workflow vs analysis)
- Complexity (simple → 3-4 phases, complex → 5-7 phases)
- User interaction needs (approval gates, input requests)
- Write vs read operations (determines tool selection)

**Process**:
1. Identify core operation (what does it do?)
2. Determine phase structure (linear, branching, iterative)
3. Identify validation gates (where to pause for approval)
4. Select tools (MCP first, then others)
5. Define state schema (what data passes between phases)

### Decision: Which Tools to Allow?

**MCP Tools First** (preferred for IAM control):
- mcp__git__* for git operations
- mcp__github__* for GitHub operations
- mcp__sequential-thinking__* for complex decisions

**Standard Tools** (when MCP unavailable):
- Read, Glob, Grep for file operations
- Write, Edit for modifications
- Bash for shell commands (when necessary)

**Restriction Strategy**:
- Omit `allowed-tools` to inherit all tools (most skills)
- Specify `allowed-tools` to restrict for security or focus
- Include sequential-thinking for complex decision skills

**Example Decisions**:
- Code review skill: Read, Glob, Grep, mcp__sequential-thinking__* (analysis only)
- Commit skill: Read, Glob, mcp__git__*, mcp__sequential-thinking__* (git operations)
- PR skill: All tools (may need to invoke other skills, create branches, etc.)

### Decision: How Many Phases?

**Factors**:
- Operation complexity (simple → 3-4, complex → 5-7)
- Validation needs (more gates → more phases)
- State transitions (each major state change → new phase)

**Common Phase Patterns**:

**Simple (3-4 phases)**:
1. Validation
2. Execution
3. Verification

**Standard (5-6 phases)**:
1. Pre-flight Validation
2. Data Gathering
3. Analysis/Decision
4. User Approval
5. Execution
6. Verification

**Complex (7+ phases)**:
1. Pre-flight Validation
2. Data Gathering
3. Analysis
4. Planning
5. User Approval
6. Execution
7. Verification
8. Reporting

## Validation Criteria
